#### ℹ️ Can we use a greedy algorithm?

Initially, I thought the problem could be solved with a greedy algorithm: just choose the highest number in each column. However, I found that a greedy algorithm didn’t always produce the optimal sum. I couldn’t choose multiple cells in the same row, because that would give multiple clusters the same color. Thus, greedily choosing a cell in one column could lock me out of choosing the highest number in a subsequent column.
