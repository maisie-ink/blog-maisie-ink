#### What does a good commit history look like?

I find that my individual commits often don’t map to individual files—they instead involve small related chunks across multiple files.

_For example…_

- ✅ **Good commit 1:** Add a new function `incrementByAmount` to `utils.js` and a test to `utils.tests.js`.
- ✅ **Good commit 2:** Add another new function `decrementByAmount` to `utils.js` and a test to `utils.tests.js`.

_Compare that with…_

- 🚫 **Bad commit 1:** Add two functions to `utils.js`.
- 🚫 **Bad commit 2:** Add tests to `utils.tests.js`.

When viewing one of the “bad commits” individually, the reviewer may be thinking “are they going to test this function?” or “what function is this test testing?”

(For a small change like this, unstructured commits aren’t a big deal. Larger PRs, however, may contain a lot of unrelated changes within one file. While that may also be a sign that the file needs re-architecting, that’s out of scope for this post.)
