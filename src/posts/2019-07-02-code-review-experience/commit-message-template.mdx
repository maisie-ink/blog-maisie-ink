#### Commit message template

##### Problem

What is the current behavior? Why is it undesirable?

##### Cause

What was the technical cause for the undesirable behavior?

##### Solution

What was the change you had to make to fix the behavior?

_If you find yourself describing how the new code works, consider adding that as a code comment instead! Commit messages are more useful for understanding why something was changed, not how the new code works._

##### Other solutions attempted

If you attempted a different solution that ended up not working, explain it here or in a code comment. Failed attempts are still useful knowledge for reviewers!

##### Resources

Consider if you can add any links. Examples include:

- A recent commit that caused the regression
- A design mockup or screenshot
- The bundle size change and license of a new dependency
- A third-party bug (e.g. a chromium bug tracker link)
- Tutorials, Stack Overflow questions, GitHub issues
