#### ℹ️ document.activeElement and CSS :active

Don't confuse `document.activeElement` with the [CSS selector `:active`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active). Confusingly, `document.activeElement` does not refer to an element that has been "activated."

`document.activeElement` is just the focused element, which corresponds to the more clearly-named [CSS selector `:focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus).
