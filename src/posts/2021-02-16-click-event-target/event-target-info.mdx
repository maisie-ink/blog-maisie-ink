#### ℹ️ What does `event.target` refer to?

`event.target` refers to the specific element that the user clicked on. In this case, it could be anything in the document, such as a `div`
or a `button`.

Don’t confuse it with `event.currentTarget`, [which refers to the element that the event handler was attached to](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event/currentTarget).
