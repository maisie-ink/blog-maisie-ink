In this post, I'll walk through implementing a custom animation. Each keypress lights up the LEDs with a random color, which then fade out upon releasing the key.

## Keyboard details

The keyboard is an [ErgoDox EZ Shine](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/customize) (configuration: white, with tilt kit, with wing rests, no keycaps, Cherry MX Brown).

The keycaps are [astrolokeys](https://astrolokeys.com/#leo) by [cassidoo](http://www.twitter.com/cassidoo) and [sailorhg](http://www.twitter.com/sailorhg). I had wanted to buy these cute pastel keycaps for a while, but I kept convincing myself I "didn't need them." (Then, when I did buy them, the alphas kit was out of stock, and the price had gone up—so the moral here is to buy things right away if you want them.)

![ErgoDox EZ with astrolokeys](./keyboard.jpg)

The "Shine" model has 15 LEDs on the underside of each keyboard half. I chose this model instead of "Glow" because I thought backlit keys wouldn't look good with opaque keycaps.

![The underside of ErgoDox EZ Shine showing the LEDs](./leds.jpg)

## QMK development environment

ErgoDox EZ uses the [QMK firmware](https://docs.qmk.fm/) by default. The firmware includes [some LED animations](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/feature_rgblight?id=effects-and-animations) already, but I wanted to try building my own. To build my own animation, I first needed a development environment to compile the firmware from source.

In my opinion, the easiest way to get started is by making a layout with the [online configurator](https://configure.zsa.io/). The online configurator will generate source code that you can use as a base for your project.

In the configurator, I added a "layer color" to each layer and a key to toggle layer lighting. That way, the generated source code would include sample code that interacts with the LEDs.

![Screenshot of the online configurator, a layer color and a key to toggle layer lighting](./layer-color.png)

Click the "Compile" button, then you'll see a link to download the source code for your layout.

![Screenshot of the online configurator, with the download source code link](./configure.png)

The downloaded source code includes a `README.md` file explaining how to set up your development environment. I recommend reading that file for the full details. In case it's helpful, here is a high-level overview of the steps I took:

- Forked and cloned [zsa/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/zsa/qmk_firmware/). (ZSA maintains their own fork of QMK that's guaranteed to work with ErgoDox EZ.)
- Copied the source code downloaded from the online configurator into `qmk_firmware/​keyboards/​ergodox_ez/​shine/​keymaps/​maisie`, where `maisie` was a new folder and the name of my layout.
- Followed QMK's [getting started](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started) guide.

Then to compile:

- Ran `make ergodox_ez/shine:maisie` (where `maisie` is the name of my layout, matching the folder I created earlier.)
- That command created `ergodox_ez_shine_maisie.hex` in the top directory.
- Used [Wally](https://ergodox-ez.com/pages/wally) to flash the `hex` file to my keyboard.

Yay! We're ready to start making changes to the source code.

## Building the LED animation

Now, I'll walk you through my process for building the `disco_mode` animation! If you just want to see the final source code: [maisieink/qmk_firmware/keymap.c](https://github.com/maisieink/qmk_firmware/blob/023d2a6c0e05186a1ebc80d30ff60b8857ea4990/keyboards/ergodox_ez/shine/keymaps/maisie/keymap.c#L554-L654).

<InfoBlock>
  <Disclaimer />
</InfoBlock>

Our base source code will contain three files, `config.h`, `keymap.c`, and `rules.mk`. Go ahead and open all of those in your favorite text editor. We'll be doing most of our work in `keymap.c`.

![screenshot of file tree](finder.png)

We'll work on this project by breaking it up into smaller, incremental features.

### First iteration: Changing all LED colors on each keypress

Let's start with a simpler version of the animation: On each keypress, we'll change the color of the LEDs on the whole keyboard. We won't include a fadeout animation or try to change individual LEDs.

Add a new function to our `keymap.c` [named `post_process_record_user`](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/advanced-keycodes/feature_macros#advanced-macros). This function is similar to `process_record_user`, but it gets called _after_ the keypress is handled. I figured that I shouldn't delay the normal keypress handling by messing around with the LEDs.

Next, copy the `rgblight` layer lighting code from our downloaded base code. The result will be:

<IdeCodeBlock
  language="c"
  title="📋 keymap.c (edited) — qmk_firmware"
  lineNumbers={false}
  code={
    `void post_process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  if (record->event.pressed) {
    // Enable rgblight
    rgblight_enable_noeeprom();
` +
    `
    // Sets animation mode to RGBLIGHT_MODE_STATIC_LIGHT so that the built-in
    // animations don't interfere with our animation
    rgblight_mode_noeeprom(1);
` +
    `
    // Set all LEDs to a random hue, but keep the saturation and value
    // ("value" means "brightness") at their max values.
    rgblight_sethsv_noeeprom(rand() % 255, 255, 255);
  }
}`
  }
/>

<InfoBlock>
  <Eeprom />
</InfoBlock>

Great! Compile and flash this code, and we'll have a keyboard that _flashes_ colors on each keypress! 😋

### Toggle button

The next thing we'll add is a _toggle button_. This flashy behavior is fun, but also distracting, so we want a way to disable it.

The [Custom Keycodes](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/custom_quantum_functions#custom-keycodes) docs can help, as well as copying the `TOGGLE_LAYER_COLOR` keycode behavior from our base code. Add the following lines to your `keymap.c`:

```c{5,12,18,24-29,36,42}
enum custom_keycodes {
  RGB_SLD = EZ_SAFE_RANGE,

  // Define a new custom keycode for our toggle button
  DISCO_TOGGLE,
};

// Add the keycode somewhere within your keymap. Here, I'm assigning it to the
// top-left key on the first layer.
const uint16_t PROGMEM keymaps[][MATRIX_ROWS][MATRIX_COLS] = {
  [0] = LAYOUT_ergodox_pretty(
    DISCO_TOGGLE,   KC_1,           KC_2,       // ...
    KC_TAB,         KC_Q,           KC_W,       // ...

// ...

// Create a variable to track the enabled/disabled state
bool disco_mode_enabled = 0;

bool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  switch (keycode) {
    // ...
    // Define the behavior for the new keycode.
    case DISCO_TOGGLE:
      if (record->event.pressed) {
        // Use a bitwise xor to toggle the value between 0 and 1
        disco_mode_enabled ^= 1;
      }
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

void post_process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  // Check if disco_mode is enabled before changing the LED colors.
  if (disco_mode_enabled) {
    if (record->event.pressed) {
      rgblight_enable_noeeprom();
      rgblight_mode_noeeprom(1);
      rgblight_sethsv_noeeprom(rand() % 255, 255, 255);
    }
  }
}
```

Now, wherever you place `DISCO_TOGGLE` in your keymap, you'll be able to press that key to toggle `disco_mode` on and off.

### Only change LEDs on one keyboard half

The next behavior I wanted to add was:

- Detect which half of the keyboard the keypress occurred on.
- Only change the LEDs on that half of the keyboard.

With a little bit of trial and error, I discovered:

- `record->event.key.row` ranges from 0–6 for keypresses on the left side of the keyboard, and 7–13 for keypress on the right side of the keyboard.
- There are [functions in `rgblight.c` for toggling the LEDs on just the left or right half of the keyboard](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/hardware-features/lighting/feature_rgblight#direct-operation). (Due to insensitive naming, I just copied the function implementations rather than calling them.)

Add these lines:

```c{7-12,22-32}
bool process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  switch (keycode) {
    // ...
    case DISCO_TOGGLE:
      if (record->event.pressed) {
        disco_mode_enabled ^= 1;
        // Move the initialization code into the DISCO_TOGGLE handler,
        // otherwise we'll accidentally clear the LEDs on the other half
        // of the keyboard on each keypress.
        rgblight_enable_noeeprom();
        rgblight_mode_noeeprom(1);
        rgblight_sethsv_noeeprom(0, 0, 0);
      }
      return false;
  }
  return true;
}

void post_process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  if (disco_mode_enabled) {
    if (record->event.pressed) {
      if (record->event.key.row < 7) {
        // Set LEDs on left side of the keyboard
        rgblight_sethsv_range(rand() % 255, 255, 255,
          (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM / 2, (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM);
      } else {
        // Set LEDs on the right side of the keyboard
        rgblight_sethsv_range(rand() % 255, 255, 255,
          0, (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM / 2);
        // rgblight_sethsv_range doesn't write to the EEPROM, which is why
        // there isn't a *_noeeprom version of the function.
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Let's try it out!

![Underside of ErgoDox EZ Shine, with half of the LEDs on each side of the keyboard lit](./led-mirror.jpg)

That wasn't quite what I was going for! Instead of lighting one side of the keyboard, it's lighting half of the LEDs on _both_ sides. 🤯

After a bit of frantic googling and searching through source code, I found out why this was happening:

```c
// Pick one of the modes
// Defaults to 15 mirror, for legacy behavior

// #define ERGODOX_LED_15 // Addresses 15 LEDs, but same position on both halves
// #define ERGODOX_LED_15_MIRROR // Addresses 15 LEDs, but are mirrored
// #define ERGODOX_LED_30 // Addresses all 30 LED individually
```

The cause:

> Defaults to 15 mirror, for legacy behavior

😳😳😳

Ok, so to define that setting, we need to open up our `config.h` file. It should look something like this:

<IdeCodeBlock
  language="c"
  title="📋 config.h (edited) — qmk_firmware"
  lineNumbers={false}
  code={`
/*
  Set any config.h overrides for your specific keymap here.
  See config.h options at https://docs.qmk.fm/#/config_options?id=the-configh-file
*/
#define ORYX_CONFIGURATOR
#define USB_SUSPEND_WAKEUP_DELAY 0
#define FIRMWARE_VERSION u8"K4JJp/OdVx9"
`}
/>

Add `#define ERGODOX_LED_30`.

```c{4}
#define ORYX_CONFIGURATOR
#define USB_SUSPEND_WAKEUP_DELAY 0
#define FIRMWARE_VERSION u8"K4JJp/OdVx9"
#define ERGODOX_LED_30
```

Now it's doing what we expect!

### Fadeout animation

Next, I wanted to add a fadeout animation to make the lighting feel more lively. Let's go back to `keymap.c` to implement this animation.

First, set up variables for keeping track of the animation state between frames. Initialize them on each keypress.

```c{1-5,11-12,17-18}
uint8_t left_hue;
uint8_t right_hue;
uint8_t left_value;
uint8_t right_value;
uint16_t animation_timer;

void post_process_record_user(uint16_t keycode, keyrecord_t *record) {
  if (disco_mode_enabled) {
    if (record->event.pressed) {
      if (record->event.key.row < 7) {
        left_hue = rand() % 255;
        left_value = 255;

        rgblight_sethsv_range(left_hue, 255, left_value,
          (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM / 2, (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM);
      } else {
        right_hue = rand() % 255;
        right_value = 255;

        rgblight_sethsv_range(right_hue, 255, right_value,
          0, (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM / 2);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Now, we'll add a new function named `matrix_scan_user`. This function gets called repeatedly, which allows us to decrease the LED brightness as the animation progresses.

Keep in mind that adding too much work to `matrix_scan_user` will [cause performance problems](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/custom_quantum_functions#matrix-scanning-code):

> Be extremely careful with the performance of code in these functions, as it will be called at least 10 times per second.

We'll avoid doing extra work by exiting early if:

- `disco_mode` is disabled, or
- there is no active animation running

Also, we'll throttle the code to run no more than once every 20ms.

```c
void matrix_init_user(void) {
  animation_timer = timer_read();
}

void matrix_scan_user(void) {
  if (
    disco_mode_enabled &&
    (left_value > 0 || right_value > 0) &&
    timer_elapsed(animation_timer) > 20
  ) {
    animation_timer = timer_read();

    // Decrement the brightness (value) of the left LEDs by 5 per frame.
    if (left_value > 0) {
      left_value -= 5;
      rgblight_sethsv_range(left_hue, 255, left_value,
        (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM / 2, (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM);
    }

    // Decrement the brightness (value) of the right LEDs by 5 per frame.
    if (right_value > 0) {
      right_value -= 5;
      rgblight_sethsv_range(right_hue, 255, right_value,
        0, (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM / 2);
    }
  }
}

```

Run that code, and the animation will look like this!

<FadeOutAnimation />

---

### Easing function

The animation didn't feel as smooth as I wanted it to, [mainly because of its linear easing](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ux/animations/the-basics-of-easing#linear_animations). There are plenty of articles explaining why linear animations feel dull, lifeless, and robotic—finding one of these articles and feeling appropriately judged is left as an exercise to the reader.

I tried out a few easing functions on the fadeout animation, and I landed on [easeOutCubic](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic) as the one I liked the most.

Here's a side-by-side comparison. Both animations last the same length of time, though the cubic easing will be nearly 90% dimmed when the animation is halfway complete.

---

<EaseComparisonAnimation />

---

Let's implement [easeOutCubic, using easings.net's sample implementation](https://easings.net/#easeOutCubic).

> Below you see the code of this easing function written in TypeScript. The variable x represents the absolute progress of the animation in the bounds of 0 (beginning of the animation) and 1 (end of animation).
>
> ```ts
> function easeOutCubic(x: number): number {
>   return 1 - pow(1 - x, 3);
> }
> ```

Our implementation will look a little different, since our animation progress variable goes from 255 to 0, and we're animating from a brightness of 255 to 0. To adjust the bounds, we'll use `easeOutCubic` like this:

```c
eased_left_value = 255 * (1 - easeOutCubic(1 - left_value / 255))
```

Expanding and simplifying that expression results in:

```c
#define CUBIC_EASE(x) ((uint32_t)(x) * (x) * (x) / 255 / 255)
```

I'm using a [C preprocessor macro](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/Macro-Arguments.html) to avoid [unnecessary function call overhead](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5226803/inline-function-v-macro-in-c-whats-the-overhead-memory-speed). (Though who knows, if I defined it as a function, maybe the compiler would've inlined it anyway 🤷‍♀️). This is the first time I've written a C macro since college which made me feel…something.

I casted to `uint32_t` to avoid integer overflow, then moved division to the end of the macro to avoid losing precision from integer division. (I also could have casted to a `float` or `double`—I haven't done any performance testing to know if that would be a better option.)

Anyway, now that we've defined our easing function, let's go ahead and use it!

```c{2, 14, 20}
// Easing function defined from 255 to 0 (rather than 0.0 to 1.0)
#define CUBIC_EASE(x) ((uint32_t)(x) * (x) * (x) / 255 / 255)

void matrix_scan_user(void) {
  if (
    disco_mode_enabled &&
    (left_value > 0 || right_value > 0) &&
    timer_elapsed(animation_timer) > 20
  ) {
    animation_timer = timer_read();

    if (left_value > 0) {
      left_value -= 5;
      rgblight_sethsv_range(left_hue, 255, CUBIC_EASE(left_value),
        (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM / 2, (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM);
    }

    if (right_value > 0) {
      right_value -= 5;
      rgblight_sethsv_range(right_hue, 255, CUBIC_EASE(right_value),
        0, (uint8_t)RGBLED_NUM / 2);
    }
  }
}

```

And here's the final result! I hope you had fun! ⭐💫✨

## Additional features

If you're interested in further exploration, I added some additional features that are beyond the scope of this blog post.

- Changed the fadeout animation to only start after all keyboard keys have been released.
- Made LEDs near the keypress brightest, and LEDs further from the keypress dimmer.
- Used the [lower-level functions](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/hardware-features/lighting/feature_rgblight#utility-functions) `sethsv` and `rgblight_set` manually. By making that change, I reduced the number of calls to `rgblight_set` and resolved some intermittent flickering behavior.

You can look at the [final source code](https://github.com/maisieink/qmk_firmware/blob/023d2a6c0e05186a1ebc80d30ff60b8857ea4990/keyboards/ergodox_ez/shine/keymaps/maisie/keymap.c#L554-L654) to see how those features are implemented. Thanks for reading! 👋
