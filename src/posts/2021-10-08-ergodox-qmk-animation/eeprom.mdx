#### ℹ️ noeeprom

`noeeprom` prevents the LED settings from being [written to the EEPROM](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/guides/custom_quantum_functions#persistent-configuration-eeprom), which stores persistent settings that won't be cleared when your keyboard loses power. Since we're changing the LED colors on every keypress anyway, there's not much need to save them as long-lived settings.
