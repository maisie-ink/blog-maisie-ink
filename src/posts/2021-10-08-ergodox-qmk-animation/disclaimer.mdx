#### ℹ️ A quick disclaimer

This is my first time working with QMK firmware, and I'm not experienced with developing in C. I'm learning as I go: from the base code we downloaded, from the [RGB Lighting docs](https://beta.docs.qmk.fm/using-qmk/hardware-features/lighting/feature_rgblight), from a [similar animation example](https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/9mx55u/i_made_a_custom_animation_with_qmk_that_reacts_to/e7im1xi/), and from skimming the [rgblight.c file](https://github.com/qmk/qmk_firmware/blob/master/quantum/rgblight/rgblight.c). That means the code I write won't be perfect, but this post will be a good example of how I approach a new technology I'm unfamiliar with.
